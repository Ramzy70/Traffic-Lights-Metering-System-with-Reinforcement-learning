Developed a reinforcement learning system using Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to optimize highway ramp metering. 
Simulated traffic withSUMO, designed state representations, and crafted reward functions to balanceramp queues, traffic flow, and speed. 
Improved traffic metrics through iterativetesting and advanced techniques like experience replay and target networks.
